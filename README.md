Introduction
============

ROTOGAMEsq is a variant of [Roto Game][1] with squared tiles. There is no code
shared, however.

Why a new Roto Game? Because: The [original author][2] has moved, and in his
new home there are squared bathroom tiles.


Coding conventions
==================

  * Coordinates that end in a `T` are in units of tiles. They are called *tile
    coordinates*.

Introduction
============

ROTOGAMEsq is a variant of [Roto Game][1] with squared tiles. There is no code
shared, however.

Why a new Roto Game? Because: The [original author][2] has moved, and in his
new home there are squared bathroom tiles.


Development
===========

  * Coordinate variable names that end in a `T` are in units of tiles (*tile
    coordinates*).
    
  * `Object.freeze` is not used due to Android 2.3's browser not supporting it.
